- **Integrate AI agents** for complex code improvements
- **Develop a hybrid workflow** combining automation and AI

## 📋 Exercise Structure

### **Phase 1: Initial Analysis** 🔍
- Run comprehensive code quality analysis
- Document all errors found
- Understand different types of issues

### **Phase 2: Automated Fixes** ⚡
- Apply automated tools to fix simple issues
- Observe changes made by tools
- Calculate improvement percentage

### **Phase 3: Comparison** 📊
- Compare results before and after
- Analyze what was fixed automatically
- Identify remaining complex issues

### **Phase 4: AI Integration** 🤖
- Use AI agents for complex errors
- Apply and validate AI suggestions
- Complete the improvement process

## 🛠️ Tools Used

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Verify setup
make help
```

### 2. Run the Exercise
```bash
# Phase 1: Record initial benchmark
make benchmark-initial

# Phase 2: Automated fixes
make fix

# Phase 3: Record post-fix benchmark and compare
make benchmark-post-autofix
make benchmark-compare

# Phase 4: AI integration (manual)
# Use AI agent to fix remaining complex issues
make benchmark-post-ai
make benchmark-report
```

### 3. Expected Results
- **Initial errors**: ~500-600 issues
- **After auto-fixer**: ~100-200 issues (60-80% improvement)
- **After AI**: ~50-100 issues (75-95% total improvement)

## 📚 Key Concepts

### **Automated Tools**
- **Advantages**: Fast, consistent, no human errors
- **Limitations**: Only simple and style errors
- **When to use**: Routine maintenance, formatting

### **AI Agents**
- **Advantages**: Understand context, can fix complex logic
- **Limitations**: Can make mistakes, require review
- **When to use**: Complex refactoring, optimization

### **Hybrid Workflow**
1. **Auto-Fixer** for basics
2. **AI** for complex issues
3. **Human review** for validation
